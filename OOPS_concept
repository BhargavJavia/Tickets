OOPS_concept
============

1) Abstract Class:-

When method name is same and you want to call derived class method. then abstract method will work.
basically when in both the class method name is same then it automatically run parent class method as by default.

2) Annonyous Function:-

Function with no name means like default function.

3) Final Keyworkd:-

use for making method final so that nobody can make changes into them. 
like constant variable.

4) Interface:-

It is next level of abstraction. 
it is used like list in large project.

5) Iterator:-

it is behaviour of this that use sequencial traversal in complex data structure.
in simple word we can work easily by dividing complex program.

6) Late binding:-

Process the method at run time is called late binding.
It directly run does not compile like other process.

7) Name Space:-

It allows to uses same name method from multiple class.
Namespace is declared at the beginning of any class.

8) Method Overloading:-

It is a way to create method with same name but diffrent working area.

9) Magic Method:-

It is a built in method that work as it defined but its entire content may changed.
it means simply working of method is same just user can change entire data as per requirement.

10) Reflection Class:-

Reflection class means that gives information about parent class that is inherited in derived class.
Information like number of methods ,  number of properties , details about parent class.

11) Traits:-

It use for multiple inheritence.
its main use for code reusability.

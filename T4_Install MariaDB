Run below commands
==================
step:1 installing MariaDB

sudo apt update
sudo apt install mariadb-server

Step:2 Configure MariaDB

sudo mysql_secure_installation

NOTE: RUNNING ALL PARTS OF THIS SCRIPT IS RECOMMENDED FOR ALL MariaDB
      SERVERS IN PRODUCTION USE!  PLEASE READ EACH STEP CAREFULLY!

In order to log into MariaDB to secure it, we'll need the current
password for the root user.  If you've just installed MariaDB, and
you haven't set the root password yet, the password will be blank,
so you should just press enter here.

Enter current password for root (enter for none): 

then
OK, successfully used password, moving on...

Setting the root password ensures that nobody can log into the MariaDB
root user without the proper authorisation.

Set root password? [Y/n] N
Step:3 (Optional) Creating an Administrative User that Employs Password Authentication 

sudo mariadb

GRANT ALL ON *.* TO 'admin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password' WITH GRANT OPTION;

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

exit

Step:4 Testing MariaDB

If MariaDB isnâ€™t running, you can start it with the command 
(sudo systemctl start mariadb)

sudo mysqladmin version

mysqladmin -u admin -p version
